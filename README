How to use this:
----------------

1) Make sure that there are no spaces in the path where you cloned
this repo. A bug in the Maven Tycho publishing process will cause
problems if you have spaces in your path.

2) Start the Jetty web server using:

   java -jar start.jar

This makes sure that all paths on your computer are the same as in the
code.

3) Change into the release engineering project and build/test using
Maven/Tycho:

   $ cd webapps/root/test.releng
   $ mvn clean install

4) To edit/debug: The workspace is in webapps/root.  Just make this 
folder be your Eclipse workspace.  Then import all projects in that
folder into your workspace.  

5) To run from the IDE:

a) Export test.app.product somewhere.  e.g.: c:\temp\test.app
b) Edit TestSynchronizeOperation class and make FIXTURE_LOCATION point 
where you exported test.app.product.
